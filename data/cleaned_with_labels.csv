1,Finally a review of the zfold 7 from an actual fold user. You can really appreciate when a creator isn't just switching from their iPhone for a week to give a review. Your opinions aren't the minor the majority just use iPhone and dont know what to expect. Perfect review once again thank you,others,3

3,I've said this before and I'll say it again. MrMobile is the best reviewer. These videos are just art.,others,3
4,my man starts the video with a shot at a beautiful large scale architecture. I love!,others,3
5,"Thank for standing up for the removal of the under display camera lol. I was very surprised to see the amount of people saying ""Oh but you can take better selfies now!"". Now with both that and S pen support being gone, there is nothing unique setting this apart from any other folding phone, shame.",design,2

THANK YOU for being the voice of the minority about the removal of the UDC! I wish that Samsung at least could've moved the hole punch to the corner of the inner display so it wouldn't be visible when watching videos",design,2

13,"I got this as a Birthday gift for my dad and he LOVES it. He can see excel sheets, sign documents, review contracts, managing his office work and talk to us on video call all without opening his laptop.",others,3
14,I'm actually in the camp of the S Pen because with the bigger screen you can now have a video playing of top with less black bars and have more space to write on the bottom half the screen. One step at a time I guess,others,3
15,"Oh my Lord, just the review. I was waiting for Nobody Does it like Mr. Mobile and I've been following you since you were in Pocket now and every time you drop a review, it's mind-blowing Exquisite. I love your videos and I've been subscribed to your channel for quite a while my guy and as soon as that pop on my shadow Blue Fold 7 as a notification, I have to jump in there and see it because I do give it to you. The phone is amazing and I parted with my z-fold six for the same reason cuz we finally get some of the things Samsung should have done in Forever.😊😊",others,3
16,The 1TB version of this phone is over $4000 here in New Zealand. Absolutely insane..,price,5
17,in love with the fold 7.. still a honeymoon phase but as someone used the previous versions starting from 2nd fold i always kept coming back to iphone... This time i already sold my iPhone for the very first time...,design,2

20,Will you be getting the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7? 🤔,others,3
21,"I'm an outdoors guy, hiking, biking, kayaking, boating fishing  and being outdoors in dusty and rainy and freezing and super hot weather. I've exposed my Fold 5 to that for two straight years with no problems. When I traded it in for the 1 TB Z Fold 7 it still looked brand new. I expect the Fold 7 to be even more rugged. I use fully protective cases when I'm out in bad conditions, including screen protector and hinge protection, but don't treat the phone gently. I fish with it sitting out in the open boat in pouring rain or in my off road buggy in tremendous dust and heat. No problems!",design,2
22,"I've had mine for 11days, replaced my Z Fold 5 with the 1TB Z Fold 7. Very pleased with it. Use a capacitive stylus and barely miss the S pen. Battery life significantly better than the Fold 5. I find myself using the silicon disc capacitive stylus on my Galaxy Book and Galaxy Tab more than the S pens they came with.",battery,0

30,"Just received fold 7 to trade for s24 ultra but haven't opened yet for 5hrs as i might regret it cos just realised no s-pen support whichs important for me (I'm deaf, my lipread isn't good), battery life etc but watching yr videos, reviews have convinced & triggered me to open now cos of multi-task, inner screen are the main reason to upgrade it! Thanks for the video! 😊",battery,0
31,We finally have another Samsung phone with a wow-factor.,design,2
32,"I have an S24 Ultra and have had my Fold 7 since launch day. I honestly, and I mean honestly, expected to my S24 Ultra but every time I open up the Fold 7 display I can't help but think its the perfect device for me. 

I've had two Tab S8 Ultra; one broke soon after purchase while I sold the other after getting my Mac Mini. I mention my S8 Ultra because I thought I wanted a huge tablet to use on the go but ultimately THIS Z Fold 7 is the perfect tablet size for me. 

Somehow, somewy Samsung has pulled a magic trick with thermal dynamics of this phone. It. Never. Runs. Hot. No matter what I throw at it. 

My only critiques?

Wish the battery was better and while I intially critizied early reviewer for saying the lack of S-Pen support is a downgrade, unfortunately I do agree with them. 

The perfect Fold 8 FOR ME, would increase battery size/type, remove inner camera all together, put S-Pen back, start at 512 GB (my Fold 7 is 512 bc of preorder special) and perhaps make the outer display a tiny bit larger.",battery,0
33,"i'm a user from vietnam, i switched to fold 7 from s23 ultra, a bit disappointed compared to a traditional phone but well, it's acceptable. if only samsung released a fold and its screen, battery, charging speed was as good as an s25 ultra then... boom... it's a real galaxy :face-blue-smiling::face-blue-smiling:",performance,4
34,Great video as always!,others,3
35,"My Fold 3 was wrecked after 2 years, cracking down the fold screen also firmware updates caused the screens to go black randomly. Hoping my Fold 7 coming tomorrow has fixed all that!",design,2
36,"Your videos are always great. I am considering replacing my Honor Magic V3.  This device is interesting, waiting to see what the new Google Pixel 10 pro fold offers.",others,3
37,"My relative replaced his iphone 15 pro for fold 7 and he is super happy with it, especially since he likes to watch videos and netflix on it, but also work on it with the business, but for me, i dont really see me using the main screen so much, it's just the hassle of opening and closing it all the time, i was close to ordering one but i thought about it once more and i will go for the iphone 17 pro max, but if samsung would have released the s26 ultra i might have gone with it.",design,2
38,"I have the Zfold 5 and I've been in love with it. Sadly my eye sight has gone some in my right eye, and completely in my left so the big display is a life saver for me. Def interested in the 7 and plan to check it out.",design,2
39,"Thanks for this extended review. In April 2022 I bought a Z Fold 3. The front phone was barely usable and the crease in the middle of the main screen was getting bigger (like it were loosening) every day since I got it. But hey, this was the gadget I needed. :-) 
After three months the crease was so big the main screen had become useless. It just looked like the main screen could fall off any moment. I  didn't risk and bought a S22 ultra. Having owned an S23 ultra and currently using an S24 ultra (with an S25 ultra available but not adding much value), the Z Fold 7 seemed like the real thing. Your review tells me (partly reading between the lines) that it's good but it might not be durably good. Thus I won't move and hope the Oneplus will eventually bring the Open 2 to the western world.",design,2

42,"I went for the 13 pro over the 13 just because of the refresh rate. If I were buying again this year, I would get the base model.",performance,4
43,"Every year I was upgrading to a pro version, starting at XS and finally at 14 pro I caught myself thinking that I have yet to use any feature that pro version provides. So this time I went with just regular 17. I don’t game on my phone, I have a pc for that. I’m not an influencer or a videographer, I’m just your regular blue collar Joe. This year 17 turned out to be perfect for all of my needs.",performance,4
44,Anybody get the base 17 instead of the Pro ONLY because of the display?,design,2
45,Upgrading my beloved 13 mini to the 17 base. Can't wait to finally have 120 Hz lol,performance,4
46,"Got the base 17 coming from a 14 pro and im good with my decision, couldn’t justify spending 300+ for an extra camera",camera,1
47,People focus so much on the spec differences without asking whether those differences will make any real World difference to them. The main difference that likely matters is the telephoto lens. And in my country you have to pay $600 more for the Pro. Tough ask.,camera,1
48,"My biggest thing is Facetime. If I buy this pro phone I want it to stay cooler when doing those calls, its the most annoying thing with my 15 pro",performance,4
49,To be clear the Pro and Pro Max do not have a 8x optical lens. It’s a 4x and cropping is used to achieve 8x “optical quality”. A big distinguishing detail.,camera,1
50,"I had pre-ordered the black iPhone Air and really loved it for the first couple of days due to just the form factor and perfect size of 6.5 inches (in between the pro and promax models), but the air’s battery life just isn’t going to work, especially when I travel and things like that. Painfully, I had to return it to Apple and get a 17 pro and have been actually very pleasantly surprised with the battery life. Just yesterday, I took my phone off the charger at 2 PM to head out for a friend’s birthday thing, was using my phone to stream college football for a couple of hours, along with checking texts and calls and other places on Google maps plus calling Lyfts and upon returning home around 10 PM, I still had 70% battery life.",battery,0
51,Went from 13 pro max to 17. Literally has everything except a larger screen and some camera features with an actual telephoto lens. Kind of weird Apple ditched the plus model this year. Most likely would’ve been the best value at $899 or something. Gonna miss the bigger screen and ProRAW but everything else is quite the upgrade,camera,1
52,I went from the 16 pro max to the base 17. Couldn’t be happier. Has everything most everyone needs.,others,3
53,"Going from the 11 base to a 17 pro, can’t wait!",others,3
54,"13:06 this doesn’t matter. The amount of ram is more for stability than it is for housing previously used applications in memory because there’s something really dumb Apple does that I see no one calling them out for. 

The way you expect apps to be held in ram ONLY applies to Apple’s own apps and NOT third party apps. 

Go ahead, launch phone, photos, pages, mail, messages etc but also load Reddit, bluesky, YouTube or whatever else you can think of. What happens to those third party apps?

They get thrown out of ram regardless of the fact that there’s plenty to store them. 

On the one hand, it makes iOS more efficient which I want more. On the other, people keep falsely praising the increase in ram when it doesn’t actually affect what folks think it does. I can’t tell you how many things I’ve lost simply because I put my phone in my pocket either while the app was open or was the last app opened and I only went back to the homescreen before pocketing my phone. 

I have the iPhone 16 by the way and yeah, that 8gb of ram has been PHENOMENAL for the stability of my device but that’s it and while it’s greatly appreciated, I do feel I need to call it out when folks say the ram is doing things it doesn’t really do. 

Now, I haven’t tested this since iOS 26 released so maybe things are different but I doubt it. Also, no, the apps in question did not update in my pocket in case that would be a retort. They simply restart because that’s how iOS manages ram

14:04 this is the one thing I was desperate to find ANYBODY talk about and thank you for confirming it. A couple minutes is significant to me personally but if I’m watching peek brightness hdr in direct sunlight, I want to be able to watch the whole film without the screen dimming. Looks like that’s still not possible sadly even with the long awaited vapor chamber cooling",performance,4

56,After I traded in my beloved iPhone 12 Mini for the 14 Pro many moons ago I got to experience what real telephoto photography on a phone can do for the quality of your photos from longer distances and never want to be without that feature again. I will definitely choose the 17 Pro if I upgrade.,camera,1

69,"Minimum width dpi setting is a great suggestion for the classic front screen is too small problem.

71,I would not recommend doing the step with the 200mp camera setting. Cause the noice increase increcibly in low light by using the 200mp setting. Due to the pixel binnning effect the photos are getting good as in the 200mp setting even when you use 12mp. I would just use the 200mp setting for nature photos in sunny days.,camera,1

179,new subbie here! love another android girly !! <3,others,3
180,Who else is watching this on their Z fold 7?😅,others,3
181,Digging mine. Been with apple for 10 years.  Kept buying each new phone every year to finally realize ive been buying the same phone with nothing new. The fold is amazing,design,2
182,I just switched from apple to Samsung. Had the 4s all the way to the 15 plus. Just swapped to the fold 7. I LOVE it. My coworkers all love it too and are amazed at the screen 😂,design,2
183,"I know people are complaining about the price but carriers and Samsung give great trade in deals. I had the Fold 4. If I traded that in for the S25 ultra, they would have only given me 400 for the phone, so I woud still pay around 899. However, my carrier (T-Mobile) gave 1100 for my Fold 4 if I went for the FOLD 7, so I would end up with the same price. I took the Fold7. Never used the pen so no loss there. Just wish the battery was better but I have a charger every where these days. Ive had it for a fews days an love it. Never going back to the old brick design. Should you pay 2000 for this for all its compromise, hell no. But nearly everyone I know is doing trade ins to get the price below 1000 which is what a lot of people spend on smart phones already. Hell, I have Apple people in my family who buy a new Apple phone each year which does hardly any sort innovation anymore (they used to when Jobs was still around). Thats insane.",price,5
184,Finally getting my fold 7 tomorrow been waiting forever for it to come in. Can't wait,others,3
185,"Having upgraded from the ZF3 to the ZF7, thank you for this video. The ZF3 was left behind on most of the AI functions, so this was useful to try and make the most out of my new foldable.
The biggest downer for me is the size of the camera bump. I know it’s required, because you can’t bend the laws of optical physics, but now I am in search of a cover that will allow it to sit flat on a table, particularly for things like interpreter mode.
What I really like though, when compared to my ZF3, is the aspect ratio of the front screen. I can do so much more without even opening the inner screen.",camera,1
186,One of the more entertaining reviews. Bravo.,others,3
187,Just bit the bullet and purchased one today. Switch from Apple To S25 Ultra to Pixel and now I'm giving the Fold world a try. Appreciate the hands on explanation.

I loved my Fold 7 so much I started hating on my tablet. didn't think the weight would bother me but it started to happen after getting used to the Fold 7. just gave my Samsung tablet to my mom lol she's so happy and I honestly don't want it anymore.,others,3

227,"I have a z fold 7 and iPhone 17 pro. The z fold is so nice it’s my main phone on my main line. Once you get used to having the big inner display it is hard to use anything else. I do prefer the cameras on the iPhone because the telephoto and video recording are better. Also, the battery life and charging speed of the iPhone are significantly better. It’s pretty ridiculous that I cary two phones around with me, but I’m a ridiculous person.",camera,1

230,"I always carry an iPhone and an android. I’m primarily an iPhone user. My android device always varies. I didn’t like the cameras on the z fold 7, I’m usually a pixel guy for cameras; but I made the mistake and used the Vivo x200 ultra for still shots and now NO other phone as of Oct. 2025 can meet that expectation. The Vivo has the best still shots I’ve ever seen on a phone period.",camera,1

Yes, I wish battery life was better and apps worked as well as on iOS, but I don't see myself using a device that cannot fold anymore 😅. This is a productivity beast, something I wasn't able to do on my iPhones unless I jumped onto my iPad, and I don't carry that thing on me all the time. I'm keeping my Z Fold7 until Apple decides to make an iPhone that folds.",battery,0
236,"I've had my fold 7 for a week after having a iPhone for the past 15 years. I'm in love with this thing, yeah the os has taken getting some used to, and I will say that the battery could be better but for that screen real estate and the versatility of the Fold 7 Apple is going to have to do a lot to win me back next time I upgrade.",battery,0

Flex Mode adds extra function to the Fold
Dual Recording on the fold lets you film from ANY 2 cameras (even rear cameras) at the same time and save them as separate videos in 4K
Rear Cam Selfie exists and will produce better results than the 10mp cover screen camera",camera,1

I get 24-26 hours of use on most days, granted it is not my main device. Work days it's in my pocket playing YouTube/music through Bluetooth sometimes and then using it during my breaks.
At home it's a small addition to my already existing tech.
And while it's an obvious solution: I charge while I sleep. Wireless, not even at full capacity. And yet it's always fully charged by the time I need it.

The inner camera is useful for video calls in flex mode, but going back to the under screen would be better in my eyes, slightly less clarity for an uninterrupted screen is worth it imo.",battery,0

344,"I'm trading my fold 5 for fold 7. I went to a retail store and see the difference myself, and man... the difference in just the weight, dimension, and feel just blew my mind. People may be asking, but is it worth the upgrade. For me, yes, because I heavily use my phone and I carry that phone in my pocket for over 10 hours at work standing and walking in a warehouse. The weight change is a huge plus for me. For me, the main upgrade is the weight and dimension. Bonus upgrade are better processor, camera, screen, the feel and hold. What I do on my fold: Heavy gaming, video watching, multi-tasking, music listening, window shopping. Basically, it's my walking PC.

For other people, it might not be worth the upgrade, especially if you are obsessed with the battery. If you are getting into the fold, fold 7 is definitely the way to go and a great start.

1) Durability
The iPhone 16 which you told to be strong durable is made up of the aluminum body similar to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 pro series. So, iPhone 17 pro should also have the same durability standards to your iPhone 16. But, scratches will be an issue on the 17 pro's plateau due to the sharp edges it has. 

2) Charging
You do not need to buy Apple's 40W charger to reach the claimed charging speeds, even with a non-AVS spec charger like Samsung's 45W charger, you can reach that same charging speeds. You can refer to GSMArena's 17 Pro Review, in its Charging Speed portion. It talks about this.

Fold 7 is amazing but thermals while gaming can be bad and the battery is subpar. iPhone 17 pro max is nice, the battery is absolutely amazing and performance is good. Lacks android ecosystem which is better in my opinion. Ios 26 is glitchy and sometimes laggy. I think once the iPhone has more time to cook it'll be an amazing phone.

I've been waiting for call screen, call recording for over 8 years since pixel 4a. Battery life on A19 is very good. Disabling Pwm is godsend and doesn't cause severe eye pain with lowest brightness.

Phone is a finger print magnet. Samsung really should take notes from the Pixel folds for most everything it's not. Battery is way too small for a foldable and when will Samsung realize that slim means heat because there's not enough room for the heat to dissipate and heat means damage to the battery and the phones circuitry.

At first, I wasn’t into foldables, but after checking out my brother’s fold7, I realised they’re on another level man.
