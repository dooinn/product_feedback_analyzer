I use fully protective cases when I'm out in bad conditions, including screen protector and hinge protection, but don't treat the phone gently. I fish with it sitting out in the open boat in pouring rain or in my off road buggy in tremendous dust and heat. No problems!",

I honestly, and I mean honestly, expected to my S24 Ultra but every time I open up the Fold 7 display I can't help but think its the perfect device for me. \n\nI've had two Tab S8 Ultra; one broke soon after purchase while I sold the other after getting my Mac Mini. I mention my S8 Ultra because I thought I wanted a huge tablet to use on the go but ultimately THIS Z Fold 7 is the perfect tablet size for me. \n\nSomehow, somewy Samsung has pulled a magic trick with thermal dynamics of this phone. It. Never. Runs. Hot. No matter what I throw at it. \n\nMy only critiques?\n\nWish the battery was better and while I intially critizied early reviewer for saying the lack of S-Pen support is a downgrade, unfortunately I do agree with them. \n\nThe perfect Fold 8 FOR ME, would increase battery size/type, remove inner camera all together, put S-Pen back, start at 512 GB (my Fold 7 is 512 bc of preorder special) and perhaps make the outer display a tiny bit larger.",

        "comment": "Thanks for this extended review. In April 2022 I bought a Z Fold 3. The front phone was barely usable and the crease in the middle of the main screen was getting bigger (like it were loosening) every day since I got it. But hey, this was the gadget I needed. :-) \nAfter three months the crease was so big the main screen had become useless. It just looked like the main screen could fall off any moment. I  didn't risk and bought a S22 ultra. Having owned an S23 ultra and currently using an S24 ultra (with an S25 ultra available but not adding much value), the Z Fold 7 seemed like the real thing. Your review tells me (partly reading between the lines) that it's good but it might not be durably good. Thus I won't move and hope the Oneplus will eventually bring the Open 2 to the western world.",

Painfully, I had to return it to Apple and get a 17 pro and have been actually very pleasantly surprised with the battery life. Just yesterday, I took my phone off the charger at 2 PM to head out for a friend’s birthday thing, was using my phone to stream college football for a couple of hours, along with checking texts and calls and other places on Google maps plus calling Lyfts and upon returning home around 10 PM, I still had 70% battery life.",

        "comment": "13:06 this doesn’t matter. The amount of ram is more for stability than it is for housing previously used applications in memory because there’s something really dumb Apple does that I see no one calling them out for. \n\nThe way you expect apps to be held in ram ONLY applies to Apple’s own apps and NOT third party apps. \n\nGo ahead, launch phone, photos, pages, mail, messages etc but also load Reddit, bluesky, YouTube or whatever else you can think of. What happens to those third party apps?\n\nThey get thrown out of ram regardless of the fact that there’s plenty to store them. \n\nOn the one hand, it makes iOS more efficient which I want more. On the other, people keep falsely praising the increase in ram when it doesn’t actually affect what folks think it does. I can’t tell you how many things I’ve lost simply because I put my phone in my pocket either while the app was open or was the last app opened and I only went back to the homescreen before pocketing my phone. \n\nI have the iPhone 16 by the way and yeah, that 8gb of ram has been PHENOMENAL for the stability of my device but that’s it and while it’s greatly appreciated, I do feel I need to call it out when folks say the ram is doing things it doesn’t really do. \n\nNow, I haven’t tested this since iOS 26 released so maybe things are different but I doubt it. Also, no, the apps in question did not update in my pocket in case that would be a retort. They simply restart because that’s how iOS manages ram\n\n14:04 this is the one thing I was desperate to find ANYBODY talk about and thank you for confirming it. A couple minutes is significant to me personally but if I’m watching peek brightness hdr in direct sunlight, I want to be able to watch the whole film without the screen dimming. Looks like that’s still not possible sadly even with the long awaited vapor chamber cooling",

Due to the pixel binnning effect the photos are getting good as in the 200mp setting even when you use 12mp. I would just use the 200mp setting for nature photos in sunny days.",

The slenderness, the light weight, the fact that I can open more than one app at a time, the picture quality is a lot better than the Fold 4 (I missed out on the 5 and 6 as I had the 4 from 2023). I swore that once I got the 4 that I'd never go back to a run of the mill mobile phone again, and with the 7, just like with the 4, this is a mini tablet. I look forward to future Samsung folds, because this is the way forward. Love from London ❤",

        "comment": "I know people are complaining about the price but carriers and Samsung give great trade in deals. I had the Fold 4. If I traded that in for the S25 ultra, they would have only given me 400 for the phone, so I woud still pay around 899. However, my carrier (T-Mobile) gave 1100 for my Fold 4 if I went for the FOLD 7, so I would end up with the same price. I took the Fold7. Never used the pen so no loss there. Just wish the battery was better but I have a charger every where these days. Ive had it for a fews days an love it. Never going back to the old brick design. Should you pay 2000 for this for all its compromise, hell no. But nearly everyone I know is doing trade ins to get the price below 1000 which is what a lot of people spend on smart phones already. Hell, I have Apple people in my family who buy a new Apple phone each year which does hardly any sort innovation anymore (they used to when Jobs was still around). Thats insane.",

        "comment": "Having upgraded from the ZF3 to the ZF7, thank you for this video. The ZF3 was left behind on most of the AI functions, so this was useful to try and make the most out of my new foldable.\nThe biggest downer for me is the size of the camera bump. I know it’s required, because you can’t bend the laws of optical physics, but now I am in search of a cover that will allow it to sit flat on a table, particularly for things like interpreter mode.\nWhat I really like though, when compared to my ZF3, is the aspect ratio of the front screen. I can do so much more without even opening the inner screen.",

I do prefer the cameras on the iPhone because the telephoto and video recording are better. Also, the battery life and charging speed of the iPhone are significantly better. It’s pretty ridiculous that I cary two phones around with me, but I’m a ridiculous person.",

Yes, I wish battery life was better and apps worked as well as on iOS, but I don't see myself using a device that cannot fold anymore 😅. This is a productivity beast, something I wasn't able to do on my iPhones unless I jumped onto my iPad, and I don't carry that thing on me all the time. I'm keeping my Z Fold7 until Apple decides to make an iPhone that folds.",

        "comment": "I'm one of the few people it seems who minds neither the battery life or charging speed.\nI get 24-26 hours of use on most days, granted it is not my main device. Work days it's in my pocket playing YouTube/music through Bluetooth sometimes and then using it during my breaks.\nAt home it's a small addition to my already existing tech.\nAnd while it's an obvious solution: I charge while I sleep. Wireless, not even at full capacity. And yet it's always fully charged by the time I need it.\n\nThe inner camera is useful for video calls in flex mode, but going back to the under screen would be better in my eyes, slightly less clarity for an uninterrupted screen is worth it imo.",

        "comment": "I'm trading my fold 5 for fold 7. I went to a retail store and see the difference myself, and man... the difference in just the weight, dimension, and feel just blew my mind. People may be asking, but is it worth the upgrade. For me, yes, because I heavily use my phone and I carry that phone in my pocket for over 10 hours at work standing and walking in a warehouse. The weight change is a huge plus for me. For me, the main upgrade is the weight and dimension. Bonus upgrade are better processor, camera, screen, the feel and hold. What I do on my fold: Heavy gaming, video watching, multi-tasking, music listening, window shopping. Basically, it's my walking PC.\n\nFor other people, it might not be worth the upgrade, especially if you are obsessed with the battery. If you are getting into the fold, fold 7 is definitely the way to go and a great start.\n\nWhat I want in the future z fold? Micro SD slot, PLEASE! S Pen is always plus (for some reason, they decide to take out s pen on fold 7, smh*). Obviously, better battery life is always a plus. Less expensive price would be nice too.",

It's so refreshing that they finally made the front screen bigger and easier to use, but yea 25 watt charging is definitely the low end but, I think it's like that because of how thin the fold is now, but im not 100% sure since there are other foldables that have faster charging rates, hopefully next iteration will be improved",

Throughout my time with the folds ive had a cheap ipad at one point and right now have a cheap 200 dallar galaxy tablet. My fold 5 was so heavy and a hated it. But this samsung tablet must weigh 325,0000 pounds with some added weight just to piss me off 😂. I never use my galaxy tablet except as a second alarm clock (cuz i like to have two). Z fold 7 is the only way to go. \nOn a side note, im only mildly interested in the galaxy tri-fold. But it's not something I'm really interested in having. But maybe I'll change my mind when I see it. I doubt it though. Im pretty content with the current state of foldables.",

Zoom calls are just fine with it. 3) Bigger battery. 4) Bring back the S-Pen. As a designer and amateur artist, the z fold 6 is an amazing sketchbook on the go and a productivity powerhouse still. In closing, these changes would make it the PERFECT phone. Samsung is getting sooo close! Great videos, as always!  You da man!",

When I got it 2 months ago I could not let it go, as it is so good for multi tasking, AI, photo editing & video consumption. I keep it with me, but my main is the Air as the ecosystem has me locked. Air Drop, FaceTime, iMessage, Apple News, Find My all my Tv's have Apple TV as primary source. It is hard to get out of the eco system and when all my family and 95% of everyone I know is on the iPhone. Can't wait for an Apple foldable.",

        "comment": "Issues with this video\n\n1) Durability\nThe iPhone 16 which you told to be strong durable is made up of the aluminum body similar to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 pro series. So, iPhone 17 pro should also have the same durability standards to your iPhone 16. But, scratches will be an issue on the 17 pro's plateau due to the sharp edges it has. \n\n2) Charging\nYou do not need to buy Apple's 40W charger to reach the claimed charging speeds, even with a non-AVS spec charger like Samsung's 45W charger, you can reach that same charging speeds. You can refer to GSMArena's 17 Pro Review, in its Charging Speed portion. It talks about this.\n\nApart from these, the other points stay valid and the iPhone 17 is plenty enough for 99% of the people.",

Fold 7 is amazing but thermals while gaming can be bad and the battery is subpar. iPhone 17 pro max is nice, the battery is absolutely amazing and performance is good. Lacks android ecosystem which is better in my opinion. Ios 26 is glitchy and sometimes laggy. I think once the iPhone has more time to cook it'll be an amazing phone. Can't go wrong with any of them but just be aware of no trade ins if you go with OnePlus.",

        "comment": "I just switched from Samsung S22 Ultra to iPhone 13 while waiting for a iPhone 17 Pro Max. I hated the Apple ecosystem because they charge for everything. If I want to listen to my saved music I can't because iTunes won't allow it. C'mon Apple. I already paid for that music why should I pay again to listen to it? I like being able to upload practically any kind of files onto an Android phone regardless of whether or not there is an application installed on the phone. This is not possible with Apple phones. If I want to edit a PDF or a word file on Apple phone I have to buy an application. Apple charges for everything. So, I cancelled the Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max order and ordered a Samsung Fold 7. Never really liked Apple because of all these issues. What a greedy company Apple is!!!!",

I have the iPhone 15 PM from work and have an upgrade but the 17 pro feels more bulky and less sleek than the 15. Is the camera a substantial upgrade? Work would pay for it but I feel I should just wait for the 18 next year. I also have the S25 Ultra for travel. Love the camera system 😅.",

If I want to listen to my saved music I can't because iTunes won't allow it. C'mon Apple. I already paid for that music why should I pay again to listen to it? I like being able to upload practically any kind of files onto an Android phone regardless of whether or not there is an application installed on the phone. This is not possible with Apple phones. If I want to edit a PDF or a word file on Apple phone I have to buy an application. Apple charges for everything. So, I cancelled the Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max order and ordered a Samsung Fold 7. Never really liked Apple because of all these issues. What a greedy company Apple is!!!!",

How does it even make sense to compare the sound quality, price, vapor chamber cooling & battery life of a phone that is thinner than the iPhone Air with a 17 Pro Max that has more internal space to fit more of everything (speakers, camera sensors, battery & adequate cooling tech).... If you really want a direct comparison this is not the battle to focus on",

        "comment": "Hello. I switched from 16 pm to s25 ultra. Really like the fold 7 but the problem is samsung is not officially launching fold 7 here in Pakistan. Have heard internal screen is still blacking out on fold 7. Fold 7 units from other regions are being sold here   but they won't have warranty on them. Will it be too risky to buy without warranty. Really want this phone 😢",

I have so many friends and family that are in the apple eco system that i sometimes feel handicapped while trying to communicate with them. I love the z fold for the entertainment aspect and multi-tasking... Thank you for this review!",

        "comment": "iPhone 17 base phone is pretty good. Just in the process of switching from pixel. The reason is sudden loss of cell reception and instant call dropping issues with Android 16 September/Oct update and Google is adamant to admit the firmware bug. \nSiri and keyboard is still a WIP. Apple keyboard adjusts faster to my typing than gboard(full of mistakes)/swiftkey(dedicated number type with , and . keys). Only best thing about it works offline unlike Gemini on older pixels. Call screen, call recording and other spam related features are available on iOS in India. I've been waiting for call screen, call recording for over 8 years since pixel 4a. Battery life on A19 is very good. Disabling Pwm is godsend and doesn't cause severe eye pain with lowest brightness.\nUsbc dongles that are certified with iPhone 16 and older don't work with iPhone 17 along with camera mods such as moment cases, camera gen lock. Ssd works as expected",

The camera bump is a freaking joke, to the point where wireless charging is lopsided and touchy and sometimes stops charging on its own. This phone is ridiculously priced especially for how quick these phones depreciate. The zoom camera is old tech and pics look horrible. Not into the tall and narrow feel to this pricey piece of tech. Phone is a finger print magnet. Samsung really should take notes from the Pixel folds for most everything it's not. Battery is way too small for a foldable and when will Samsung realize that slim means heat because there's not enough room for the heat to dissipate and heat means damage to the battery and the phones circuitry. I like foldable phones just not Samsungs. Will not be purchasing one again any time soon. OnePlus and Pixel are less expensive and far better technology IMO.",

        "comment": "Warning.  Hopefully, Samsug has improved the big screen  since I bought it. But I have a Fold 4, and within the 1st 6 months, the internal screen started to \"bleed\"/black hole at the crease. And the place they send customers to fix it NEVER had the replacement  screens in stock...NEVER! So I only experienced the full screen for 6 months... not worth the money, in my opinion, unless they have fixed the problem with the crease (so many people had that bleeding issue), and you can get the internal screen fixed immediately.",

Also you are getting 120hz on the base model without spending 400 extra bucks (really can’t see the valué on that, ur just getting a better camera and I did not used all the power of it).",

Makes more sense on the fold using its big inner display. Zoom 100x looks like ass. Pen will depend on the person. Yes it’s a great phone but it being better? Well that depends on what you prioritize on a phone.",

My entire day is 8am - 9pm, my Fold 7 has never lasted an entire day for me. Regularly down to 10-15% by late afternoon and needs a top up just in case.\n\nBy the way I'd never choose an iPhone due to IOS. Too restrictive and forces you to use the rest of the Apple products.",

SPen makes more sense on this phone than the Ultra with more screen to write on, I've only used the SPen a handful of times on my Notes/Ultras.

Because as is, they were NEVER going to do that.\n\n15:00 ...New Balance still doin' the thang??? Think I may have to hunt them down, haven't seen any that I actually like in a couple decades now.

The notch was better, it sat at the edge and stayed out of the way. Dynamic Island just drags the notch further into the display and eats up more pixels. The space between the cutout and the phone’s edge? Pure wasted screen real estate.",

After talking some sense into myself in that regard, I dropped out of the Pro line (14 Pro Max) to get a regular 17 this year. The lack of ProMotion display in the base iPhone was one of the biggest things holding me back from upgrading before. I finally am free of the lightning cable!",

I genuinely could not believe Apple packed that much in on it. It's too good to pass up.\n\nI don't care for the cameras much so the only point of contention was 8gb vs 12gb of ram. But I'll keep the base 17 for 3 or 4 years and by that time, phones will have 20/24gb of ram anyway, far higher than the 12gb of ram on the current Pros.",

DEX mode turns any monitor/TV into a fully dedicated Desktop Setup, Ideal for office/school work, 2. KIDS MODE, the entirety of the phone turns into a super cool Kids only phone completely changing the entire phones operating system which is very handy! I work with kids so this is a plus for me. 3. Would be your standard but super advance operating system for normal/daily usage of the phone 😎 20/10 worth it! ALSO, new updates are making it so the Z Fold easily just integrates/interacts with apple products, as well as allowing a crossover of some features. So if your entire ecosystem of electronics is solely ios/apple, no need to worry with the Z Fold 7!",

Best phone I've ever owned. \n\nDon't forget to enable developer options and increase minimum width to 480 for the outer screen. (I prefer 520 for the inner screen). It is by far the best quality of life setting you can change and the first thing I do when I get a new phone. Makes it so you can fit so much more on the screen at once. Yet none of these videos ever bring it up.",

It's the only reason I traded in my S25 Ultra for this phone and I'll ignore the S26 Ultra come January.",

At first, I wasn’t into foldables, but after checking out my brother’s fold7, I realised they’re on another level man. Apple just needs to refine their OS a bit… Imagine iOS with some of Android’s best features and a foldable design like Samsung’s ...!! that would be a dream come true for most highest %..",

        "comment": "Been on apple since iphone 6, got tired of sameish phones. Before I did a jump from 12 pro max to 15 pro max and it didnt felt like an improvent apart from higher refresh rate. Snagged fold 7 and the excitement in tech is back. Gonna try to keep it untill apple makes at least gen 2 fold or just upgrade to a newer fold if they still delay. But iphone users beware, android is still more finicky to use than ios. But much less of a shock compared to last time I tried galaxy s7 edge instead of my iphone 6 lol.",

        "comment": "bro All base iphones have been aluminium for years now and they have been reliable too. whats the issue with this 17 pro aluminium that all the previous base iphones didnt have? i think the people who have the money for Pro mess around with the phone , ending up with dents meanwhile the ones with base iPhones dont have it in them to drop it or test it. i think this is the reality. however they should be a proper quality check n a video to differentiate between the aluminium in base iPhones and this aluminium unibody. However this Aluminium makes the iPhone 17 pro more shatter resistant as it takes more of the impact compared to Titanium that transfers the impact directly to the front n back glass shattering it easily. But yeah apple shouldve worked on a better frame at least",

I also installed Microsoft Launcher just for the daily wallpapers. I have a little folding keyboard with trackpad and am waiting for a case to arrive tomorrow (I know that some purists say don't use a case on it, but it's my investment and I feel like protecting it, plus I need a kickstand). With that setup, I can use it like my S8+ tablet that I'm trying to replace. It's a really cool little phone and it might end up replacing my S23 Ultra, instead.",

In other words, the Samsung Z Fold 7 is a real failure for Samsung, despite the terrifying influencer support for its launch. The media coverage was also unsuccessful, as it was largely self-sufficient. Everyone was talking about it. Regarding the thickness? Who cares it means nothing to me, what matters is the productivity which was gone already!!!!",

And there's a reason why non-chinese brands didn't embrace that. \n\nA clever marketing ploy by the Chinese brands that also helps degrade the battery much quicker to force earlier upgrades. \n\nAnd the battery life doesn't even improve that much despite the 50% increase in capacity on paper. \n\nAlready we are seeing bans on charging in flight, I wonder why.",

I went PRO before for the 120 Hz refresh, but that is now standard on non-PRO's. Good resale value on the 15 pro so the upgrade in my case only requires a small investment.",

With iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, I feel frustrated by the new “liquid glass” interface. For me, it looks distracting and uncomfortable to use compared to iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\nMy suggestion for Apple is to add an option in Settings > Appearance that allows users to choose between different interface styles (past designs included). This way, those who like the new look can keep it, and those who prefer the previous style can switch back.",
