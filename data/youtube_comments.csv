I've had two Tab S8 Ultra; one broke soon after purchase while I sold the other after getting my Mac Mini. I mention my S8 Ultra because I thought I wanted a huge tablet to use on the go but ultimately THIS Z Fold 7 is the perfect tablet size for me. 

Somehow, somewy Samsung has pulled a magic trick with thermal dynamics of this phone. It. Never. Runs. Hot. No matter what I throw at it. 

My only critiques?

Wish the battery was better and while I intially critizied early reviewer for saying the lack of S-Pen support is a downgrade, unfortunately I do agree with them. 

The perfect Fold 8 FOR ME, would increase battery size/type, remove inner camera all together, put S-Pen back, start at 512 GB (my Fold 7 is 512 bc of preorder special) and perhaps make the outer display a tiny bit larger.",1

UgzaGe1gGyUm1PceRH94AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C14otKq7qQY,"Thanks for this extended review. In April 2022 I bought a Z Fold 3. The front phone was barely usable and the crease in the middle of the main screen was getting bigger (like it were loosening) every day since I got it. But hey, this was the gadget I needed. :-) 
After three months the crease was so big the main screen had become useless. It just looked like the main screen could fall off any moment. I  didn't risk and bought a S22 ultra. Having owned an S23 ultra and currently using an S24 ultra (with an S25 ultra available but not adding much value), the Z Fold 7 seemed like the real thing. Your review tells me (partly reading between the lines) that it's good but it might not be durably good. Thus I won't move and hope the Oneplus will eventually bring the Open 2 to the western world.",0

Painfully, I had to return it to Apple and get a 17 pro and have been actually very pleasantly surprised with the battery life.

Ugzk5DtjPnaIK8n5WYF4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lV4cykAiL4,"13:06 this doesn’t matter. The amount of ram is more for stability than it is for housing previously used applications in memory because there’s something really dumb Apple does that I see no one calling them out for. 

The way you expect apps to be held in ram ONLY applies to Apple’s own apps and NOT third party apps. 

Go ahead, launch phone, photos, pages, mail, messages etc but also load Reddit, bluesky, YouTube or whatever else you can think of. What happens to those third party apps?

They get thrown out of ram regardless of the fact that there’s plenty to store them. 

On the one hand, it makes iOS more efficient which I want more. On the other, people keep falsely praising the increase in ram when it doesn’t actually affect what folks think it does. I can’t tell you how many things I’ve lost simply because I put my phone in my pocket either while the app was open or was the last app opened and I only went back to the homescreen before pocketing my phone. 

I have the iPhone 16 by the way and yeah, that 8gb of ram has been PHENOMENAL for the stability of my device but that’s it and while it’s greatly appreciated, I do feel I need to call it out when folks say the ram is doing things it doesn’t really do. 

Now, I haven’t tested this since iOS 26 released so maybe things are different but I doubt it. Also, no, the apps in question did not update in my pocket in case that would be a retort. They simply restart because that’s how iOS manages ram

If I traded that in for the S25 ultra, they would have only given me 400 for the phone, so I woud still pay around 899. However, my carrier (T-Mobile) gave 1100 for my Fold 4 if I went for the FOLD 7, so I would end up with the same price. I took the Fold7. Never used the pen so no loss there. Just wish the battery was better but I have a charger every where these days. Ive had it for a fews days an love it. Never going back to the old brick design. Should you pay 2000 for this for all its compromise, hell no. But nearly everyone I know is doing trade ins to get the price below 1000 which is what a lot of people spend on smart phones already. Hell, I have Apple people in my family who buy a new Apple phone each year which does hardly any sort innovation anymore (they used to when Jobs was still around). Thats insane.",1

The biggest downer for me is the size of the camera bump. I know it’s required, because you can’t bend the laws of optical physics, but now I am in search of a cover that will allow it to sit flat on a table, particularly for things like interpreter mode.
What I really like though, when compared to my ZF3, is the aspect ratio of the front screen. I can do so much more without even opening the inner screen.",0

For me, yes, because I heavily use my phone and I carry that phone in my pocket for over 10 hours at work standing and walking in a warehouse. The weight change is a huge plus for me. For me, the main upgrade is the weight and dimension. Bonus upgrade are better processor, camera, screen, the feel and hold. What I do on my fold: Heavy gaming, video watching, multi-tasking, music listening, window shopping. Basically, it's my walking PC.

For other people, it might not be worth the upgrade, especially if you are obsessed with the battery. If you are getting into the fold, fold 7 is definitely the way to go and a great start.

UgyiNAeCnt3wtpRiZRB4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVm2Q0EMiR0,"Issues with this video

1) Durability
The iPhone 16 which you told to be strong durable is made up of the aluminum body similar to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 pro series. So, iPhone 17 pro should also have the same durability standards to your iPhone 16. But, scratches will be an issue on the 17 pro's plateau due to the sharp edges it has. 

2) Charging
You do not need to buy Apple's 40W charger to reach the claimed charging speeds, even with a non-AVS spec charger like Samsung's 45W charger, you can reach that same charging speeds. You can refer to GSMArena's 17 Pro Review, in its Charging Speed portion. It talks about this.

Apart from these, the other points stay valid and the iPhone 17 is plenty enough for 99% of the people.",0

The reason is sudden loss of cell reception and instant call dropping issues with Android 16 September/Oct update and Google is adamant to admit the firmware bug. 
Siri and keyboard is still a WIP. Apple keyboard adjusts faster to my typing than gboard(full of mistakes)/swiftkey(dedicated number type with , and . keys). Only best thing about it works offline unlike Gemini on older pixels. Call screen, call recording and other spam related features are available on iOS in India. I've been waiting for call screen, call recording for over 8 years since pixel 4a. Battery life on A19 is very good. Disabling Pwm is godsend and doesn't cause severe eye pain with lowest brightness.

The camera bump is a freaking joke, to the point where wireless charging is lopsided and touchy and sometimes stops charging on its own. This phone is ridiculously priced especially for how quick these phones depreciate. The zoom camera is old tech and pics look horrible. Not into the tall and narrow feel to this pricey piece of tech. Phone is a finger print magnet. Samsung really should take notes from the Pixel folds for most everything it's not. Battery is way too small for a foldable and when will Samsung realize that slim means heat because there's not enough room for the heat to dissipate and heat means damage to the battery and the phones circuitry. I like foldable phones just not Samsungs. Will not be purchasing one again any time soon. OnePlus and Pixel are less expensive and far better technology IMO.",1

UgwnSufpTDJp7kYl69d4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALEJ919NdI4,"The complete lack of S Pen support here along with the dumbed down S Pen in the S25 Ultra (we all the way back in 2017 with the Note8 here...which ain't that bad, the Note8 is where I got into the Galaxy Note line), not to mention the smaller battery size and the slow charging speeds...yeah, that stuff is a big pain point right alongside the pricing.

But let's be real, if their excuse is that ""nobody's using it"", it's their own fault - if they had it embedded into the body, it would've gotten more use than what they thought. Because as is, they were NEVER going to do that.

15:00 ...New Balance still doin' the thang??? Think I may have to hunt them down, haven't seen any that I actually like in a couple decades now.

I don't care for the cameras much so the only point of contention was 8gb vs 12gb of ram. But I'll keep the base 17 for 3 or 4 years and by that time, phones will have 20/24gb of ram anyway, far higher than the 12gb of ram on the current Pros.",3

Then some other extra discounds makig it for me

989€ for 256g sage 17, at the dutch apple store.

with my provider 
799€, for the phone 
17€ less each month for the provider equals 408€ in two years

Then, I can sell my old 15 pro for estimimate of 550€ with broken backplate and 83% battery state.

I am going to miss the design off my 15 Pro blue, but so far the 17 is doing better then I expected.

I got the 17 base for about 250€ if I’m going te sell my 15 pro.

However this Aluminium makes the iPhone 17 pro more shatter resistant as it takes more of the impact compared to Titanium that transfers the impact directly to the front n back glass shattering it easily.
