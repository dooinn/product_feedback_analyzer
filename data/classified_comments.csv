Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,I'm actually in the camp of the S Pen because with the bigger screen you can now have a video playing of top with less black bars and have more space to write on the bottom half the screen. One step at a time I guess,18,others

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I'm an outdoors guy, hiking, biking, kayaking, boating fishing  and being outdoors in dusty and rainy and freezing and super hot weather. I've exposed my Fold 5 to that for two straight years with no problems. When I traded it in for the 1 TB Z Fold 7 it still looked brand new. I expect the Fold 7 to be even more rugged. I use fully protective cases when I'm out in bad conditions, including screen protector and hinge protection, but don't treat the phone gently. I fish with it sitting out in the open boat in pouring rain or in my off road buggy in tremendous dust and heat. No problems!",7,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I've had mine for 11days, replaced my Z Fold 5 with the 1TB Z Fold 7. Very pleased with it. Use a capacitive stylus and barely miss the S pen.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"Just received fold 7 to trade for s24 ultra but haven't opened yet for 5hrs as i might regret it cos just realised no s-pen support whichs important for me (I'm deaf, my lipread isn't good), battery life etc but watching yr videos, reviews have convinced & triggered me to open now cos of multi-task, inner screen are the main reason to upgrade it! Thanks for the video! 😊",0,battery
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,We finally have another Samsung phone with a wow-factor.,1,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I have an S24 Ultra and have had my Fold 7 since launch day. I honestly, and I mean honestly, expected to my S24 Ultra but every time I open up the Fold 7 display I can't help but think its the perfect device for me. 

I've had two Tab S8 Ultra; one broke soon after purchase while I sold the other after getting my Mac Mini. I mention my S8 Ultra because I thought I wanted a huge tablet to use on the go but ultimately THIS Z Fold 7 is the perfect tablet size for me. 

Somehow, somewy Samsung has pulled a magic trick with thermal dynamics of this phone. It. Never. Runs. Hot. No matter what I throw at it. 

My only critiques?

Wish the battery was better and while I intially critizied early reviewer for saying the lack of S-Pen support is a downgrade, unfortunately I do agree with them. 

The perfect Fold 8 FOR ME, would increase battery size/type, remove inner camera all together, put S-Pen back, start at 512 GB (my Fold 7 is 512 bc of preorder special) and perhaps make the outer display a tiny bit larger.",1,battery
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"i'm a user from vietnam, i switched to fold 7 from s23 ultra, a bit disappointed compared to a traditional phone but well, it's acceptable. if only samsung released a fold and its screen, battery, charging speed was as good as an s25 ultra then... boom... it's a real galaxy :face-blue-smiling::face-blue-smiling:",0,performance

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"My relative replaced his iphone 15 pro for fold 7 and he is super happy with it, especially since he likes to watch videos and netflix on it, but also work on it with the business, but for me, i dont really see me using the main screen so much, it's just the hassle of opening and closing it all the time, i was close to ordering one but i thought about it once more and i will go for the iphone 17 pro max, but if samsung would have released the s26 ultra i might have gone with it.",0,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I have the Zfold 5 and I've been in love with it. Sadly my eye sight has gone some in my right eye, and completely in my left so the big display is a life saver for me. Def interested in the 7 and plan to check it out.",1,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"Thanks for this extended review. In April 2022 I bought a Z Fold 3. The front phone was barely usable and the crease in the middle of the main screen was getting bigger (like it were loosening) every day since I got it. But hey, this was the gadget I needed. :-) 
After three months the crease was so big the main screen had become useless. It just looked like the main screen could fall off any moment. I  didn't risk and bought a S22 ultra. Having owned an S23 ultra and currently using an S24 ultra (with an S25 ultra available but not adding much value), the Z Fold 7 seemed like the real thing. Your review tells me (partly reading between the lines) that it's good but it might not be durably good. Thus I won't move and hope the Oneplus will eventually bring the Open 2 to the western world.",0,design

So this time I went with just regular 17. I don’t game on my phone, I have a pc for that. I’m not an influencer or a videographer, I’m just your regular blue collar Joe.

Iphone 17,People focus so much on the spec differences without asking whether those differences will make any real World difference to them. The main difference that likely matters is the telephoto lens. And in my country you have to pay $600 more for the Pro. Tough ask.,3,camera

Iphone 17,To be clear the Pro and Pro Max do not have a 8x optical lens. It’s a 4x and cropping is used to achieve 8x “optical quality”. A big distinguishing detail.,0,camera
Iphone 17,"I had pre-ordered the black iPhone Air and really loved it for the first couple of days due to just the form factor and perfect size of 6.5 inches (in between the pro and promax models), but the air’s battery life just isn’t going to work, especially when I travel and things like that. Painfully, I had to return it to Apple and get a 17 pro and have been actually very pleasantly surprised with the battery life. Just yesterday, I took my phone off the charger at 2 PM to head out for a friend’s birthday thing, was using my phone to stream college football for a couple of hours, along with checking texts and calls and other places on Google maps plus calling Lyfts and upon returning home around 10 PM, I still had 70% battery life.",0,battery
Iphone 17,Went from 13 pro max to 17. Literally has everything except a larger screen and some camera features with an actual telephoto lens. Kind of weird Apple ditched the plus model this year. Most likely would’ve been the best value at $899 or something. Gonna miss the bigger screen and ProRAW but everything else is quite the upgrade,6,camera

Iphone 17,"13:06 this doesn’t matter. The amount of ram is more for stability than it is for housing previously used applications in memory because there’s something really dumb Apple does that I see no one calling them out for. 

The way you expect apps to be held in ram ONLY applies to Apple’s own apps and NOT third party apps. 

Go ahead, launch phone, photos, pages, mail, messages etc but also load Reddit, bluesky, YouTube or whatever else you can think of. What happens to those third party apps?

They get thrown out of ram regardless of the fact that there’s plenty to store them. 

On the one hand, it makes iOS more efficient which I want more. On the other, people keep falsely praising the increase in ram when it doesn’t actually affect what folks think it does. I can’t tell you how many things I’ve lost simply because I put my phone in my pocket either while the app was open or was the last app opened and I only went back to the homescreen before pocketing my phone. 

I have the iPhone 16 by the way and yeah, that 8gb of ram has been PHENOMENAL for the stability of my device but that’s it and while it’s greatly appreciated, I do feel I need to call it out when folks say the ram is doing things it doesn’t really do. 

Now, I haven’t tested this since iOS 26 released so maybe things are different but I doubt it. Also, no, the apps in question did not update in my pocket in case that would be a retort. They simply restart because that’s how iOS manages ram

14:04 this is the one thing I was desperate to find ANYBODY talk about and thank you for confirming it. A couple minutes is significant to me personally but if I’m watching peek brightness hdr in direct sunlight, I want to be able to watch the whole film without the screen dimming. Looks like that’s still not possible sadly even with the long awaited vapor chamber cooling",0,performance

Iphone 17,After I traded in my beloved iPhone 12 Mini for the 14 Pro many moons ago I got to experience what real telephoto photography on a phone can do for the quality of your photos from longer distances and never want to be without that feature again.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,Digging mine. Been with apple for 10 years.  Kept buying each new phone every year to finally realize ive been buying the same phone with nothing new. The fold is amazing,7,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,I just switched from apple to Samsung. Had the 4s all the way to the 15 plus. Just swapped to the fold 7. I LOVE it. My coworkers all love it too and are amazed at the screen 😂,2,design
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I know people are complaining about the price but carriers and Samsung give great trade in deals. I had the Fold 4. If I traded that in for the S25 ultra, they would have only given me 400 for the phone, so I woud still pay around 899. However, my carrier (T-Mobile) gave 1100 for my Fold 4 if I went for the FOLD 7, so I would end up with the same price. I took the Fold7. Never used the pen so no loss there. Just wish the battery was better but I have a charger every where these days. Ive had it for a fews days an love it. Never going back to the old brick design. Should you pay 2000 for this for all its compromise, hell no. But nearly everyone I know is doing trade ins to get the price below 1000 which is what a lot of people spend on smart phones already. Hell, I have Apple people in my family who buy a new Apple phone each year which does hardly any sort innovation anymore (they used to when Jobs was still around). Thats insane.",1,price
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,Finally getting my fold 7 tomorrow been waiting forever for it to come in. Can't wait,0,others
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"Having upgraded from the ZF3 to the ZF7, thank you for this video. The ZF3 was left behind on most of the AI functions, so this was useful to try and make the most out of my new foldable.
The biggest downer for me is the size of the camera bump. I know it’s required, because you can’t bend the laws of optical physics, but now I am in search of a cover that will allow it to sit flat on a table, particularly for things like interpreter mode.
What I really like though, when compared to my ZF3, is the aspect ratio of the front screen. I can do so much more without even opening the inner screen.",0,camera

I'm keeping my Z Fold7 until Apple decides to make an iPhone that folds.",1,battery
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I've had my fold 7 for a week after having a iPhone for the past 15 years. I'm in love with this thing, yeah the os has taken getting some used to, and I will say that the battery could be better but for that screen real estate and the versatility of the Fold 7 Apple is going to have to do a lot to win me back next time I upgrade.",0,battery

I get 24-26 hours of use on most days, granted it is not my main device. Work days it's in my pocket playing YouTube/music through Bluetooth sometimes and then using it during my breaks.
At home it's a small addition to my already existing tech.
And while it's an obvious solution: I charge while I sleep. Wireless, not even at full capacity. And yet it's always fully charged by the time I need it.

The inner camera is useful for video calls in flex mode, but going back to the under screen would be better in my eyes, slightly less clarity for an uninterrupted screen is worth it imo.",1,battery

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"I'm trading my fold 5 for fold 7. I went to a retail store and see the difference myself, and man... the difference in just the weight, dimension, and feel just blew my mind. People may be asking, but is it worth the upgrade. For me, yes, because I heavily use my phone and I carry that phone in my pocket for over 10 hours at work standing and walking in a warehouse. The weight change is a huge plus for me. For me, the main upgrade is the weight and dimension. Bonus upgrade are better processor, camera, screen, the feel and hold. What I do on my fold: Heavy gaming, video watching, multi-tasking, music listening, window shopping. Basically, it's my walking PC.

For other people, it might not be worth the upgrade, especially if you are obsessed with the battery. If you are getting into the fold, fold 7 is definitely the way to go and a great start.

Iphone 17,"Issues with this video

1) Durability
The iPhone 16 which you told to be strong durable is made up of the aluminum body similar to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 pro series. So, iPhone 17 pro should also have the same durability standards to your iPhone 16. But, scratches will be an issue on the 17 pro's plateau due to the sharp edges it has. 

2) Charging
You do not need to buy Apple's 40W charger to reach the claimed charging speeds, even with a non-AVS spec charger like Samsung's 45W charger, you can reach that same charging speeds. You can refer to GSMArena's 17 Pro Review, in its Charging Speed portion. It talks about this.

Apart from these, the other points stay valid and the iPhone 17 is plenty enough for 99% of the people.",0,others

Fold 7 is amazing but thermals while gaming can be bad and the battery is subpar. iPhone 17 pro max is nice, the battery is absolutely amazing and performance is good. Lacks android ecosystem which is better in my opinion. Ios 26 is glitchy and sometimes laggy. I think once the iPhone has more time to cook it'll be an amazing phone.

Iphone 17,"iPhone 17 base phone is pretty good. Just in the process of switching from pixel. The reason is sudden loss of cell reception and instant call dropping issues with Android 16 September/Oct update and Google is adamant to admit the firmware bug. 
Siri and keyboard is still a WIP. Apple keyboard adjusts faster to my typing than gboard(full of mistakes)/swiftkey(dedicated number type with , and . keys). Only best thing about it works offline unlike Gemini on older pixels. Call screen, call recording and other spam related features are available on iOS in India. I've been waiting for call screen, call recording for over 8 years since pixel 4a. Battery life on A19 is very good. Disabling Pwm is godsend and doesn't cause severe eye pain with lowest brightness.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"Probably the reason Samsung is staying away from the carbon fiber battery for now is because there are potential drawbacks: carbon fiber batteries can interfere with wireless charging, while strong carbon fiber can be more brittle and prone to shattering, and it's very hard to recycle.",0,battery
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7,"Had this phone for a couple weeks and you can have it. May be thin if you like that sort of thing, I don't. The camera bump is a freaking joke, to the point where wireless charging is lopsided and touchy and sometimes stops charging on its own. This phone is ridiculously priced especially for how quick these phones depreciate. The zoom camera is old tech and pics look horrible. Not into the tall and narrow feel to this pricey piece of tech. Phone is a finger print magnet. Samsung really should take notes from the Pixel folds for most everything it's not. Battery is way too small for a foldable and when will Samsung realize that slim means heat because there's not enough room for the heat to dissipate and heat means damage to the battery and the phones circuitry. I like foldable phones just not Samsungs. Will not be purchasing one again any time soon. OnePlus and Pixel are less expensive and far better technology IMO.",1,camera

I'm not saying it's ""impossible"" to get those things and keep the same build but I'm more than willing to give up all that to keep this build. It's the only reason I traded in my S25 Ultra for this phone and I'll ignore the S26 Ultra come January.",0,design

At first, I wasn’t into foldables, but after checking out my brother’s fold7, I realised they’re on another level man.
